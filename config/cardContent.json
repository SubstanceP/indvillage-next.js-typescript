    "description": "We recognize the natural course of aging will likely involve changes to your abilities and needs, and we have solutions for that.  Our ideas allow you to choose and manage your care and health.CUSTOMIZED CARE: Our care partners, located in our Wellness Center, mirror our own commitment to seniors and your care needs are their sole focus. Sit down with them. Share your thoughts. And let them tailor a service plan specific to your needs. Whether it’s dressing assistance in the morning, showering at night, medication reminders, or a few weeks support after an illness, they are here to give you the care and confidence you need to be your best you. We call this ‘living with assistance’, not assisted living!  We believe you should never be a “level of care.” We want you to thrive independently, knowing help is just a call away. Here, it is not the quantity of care that’s measured…it’s the quality of life! RESPITE STAYS: Offering the perfect transition from hospital or rehab to home, respite stays include all resident services and access to the care and support needed to return confidently home. Join our family, if just for a “visit,” and let the healing continue!",

    "description": "Now, more than ever senior living really matters… In the middle of uncertainty, it’s essential to have experienced leadership to maintain calm and provide comfort. Our communities implemented early safeguards to ensure our healthy environment remained that way, and our exceptional staff and management have done the impossible: to date our family of communities remain entirely Covid free. More importantly, our family of residents remained socially connected to one another, enjoyed laughter, activities, and home cooked meals ~ all without interruption. We limited access but did not discourage living. It was important to us our seniors enjoyed life without the upset so many of us had to endure. Senior living, done well, provides seniors the lifestyle they’ve earned and the confidence they deserve. Warm hospitality, delicious home cooking, activities and events, exercise programs, fresh air outings, and concierge services are just the beginning. Life really gets started when carefree days begin and security, safety, and good health surround you. Our full-time management, 24-hour staffing, and Wellness partners are all in place to seamlessly deliver on our commitment to your loved ones. Life in style ~ count on us.",
